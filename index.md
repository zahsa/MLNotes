**Derivative** represents the slope of the tangent of a function. It points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the function.

**Gradient** is a multi-variable generalization of the derivative. The gradient is a vector-valued, while the derivative is a scalar-valued.

**Jacobian** is a matrix that contains the first-order partial derivatives of all the variables of a function.

**Hessian** is a matrix that contains the second-order partial derivatives of all the variables of a function.
