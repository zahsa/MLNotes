## neurons and glia

- there are approximately equal numbers of neurons and glia in the adult human brain (roughly 85 billion of each type)
- neurons are responsible for most of the unique functions of the brain. It is the neurons that sense changes in the environment, communicate these changes to other neurons, and command the body’s responses to these sensations.

- Glia , or glial cells , contribute to brain function mainly by insulating, supporting, and nourishing neighboring neurons. the term glia is derived
from the Greek word for “glue,” giving the impression that the main function of these cells is to keep the brain from running out of our ears!
